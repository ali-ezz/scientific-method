## 📚 Course Information

- **Course Name**: Creative Thinking  
- **Course Code**: GEN113  
- **Semester**: Spring 2024  
- **University**: Helwan National University  
- **Faculty**: Computer Science & Information Technology  

---
## ❓ Research Question

**Does the ease of use of the user interface affect users' satisfaction with the information system and their return?**

## 🔬 Scientific Method Steps

### 1. Detecting a Question  
The research stemmed from personal web browsing experiences where ease of use impacted emotional response and return behavior.

### 2. Gathering Information  
The team studied how human brains prefer simplicity, referencing neuroscience articles and psychology books.

### 3. Proposing a Hypothesis  
**A well-designed, intuitive UI increases user satisfaction and the likelihood of returning to or recommending a product.**

### 4. Testing the Hypothesis  
Two desktop encyclopedia programs were created:
- **Version A**: Clean UI with intuitive design and good UX practices  
- **Version B**: Cluttered and inconsistent UI  

Both were distributed on social media platforms.

### 5. Collecting and Interpreting Data  
Polls and surveys were conducted via:
- Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn
- Instagram, Twitter, Quora
- Busuu, HelloTalk

All user types (programmers, non-programmers, lecturers, students) consistently favored the intuitive design.

### 6. Analyzing Results  
Results showed a **clear preference for the simpler UI**, aligning with the hypothesis and brain behavior studies.

### 7. Conclusion  
> **The easier the UI, the more users enjoy and return to the system.**  
This supports both theoretical expectations and real-world feedback.
